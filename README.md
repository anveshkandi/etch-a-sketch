This is my third project in my Odin Project journey. It is a basic game where you can use your cursor
to draw on a canvas at the resolution of the user's choosing.

Options:

Greyscale - Each pass over a square will darken it by about 10%.

Rainbow - Each pass over a square will color it a random color.

Eraser - Sets pen color to white so you can erase your drawing.

Change Grid Size - Prompts you to enter a value, and recreates a "userValue x userValue" sized grid.
Be careful, as there is bounds checking so very large numbers can create instability.

Clear - Clears the grid and returns it to its default state.
